title: The Kingdom of Orak

(Just a placeholder name lazily adapted from the ancient
Mesopotamian "Uruk")

The rivers originate in the mountains and flow out to the seas which creates an especially fertile and easily defensible territory in the southeast of the continent. This is just a sketch of the region and its biome; obviously the final version will probably be totally different.](/home/john/pictures/rpg/orak-rough-map.png)

## General Overview

My inspiration for Orak comes from a combination of ancient
Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Aztec societies. I'm envisioning a
federation of large settlements with advanced agriculture and
complex cities governed by the monarch of the largest, most
powerful city. Their political system is religiously legitimated by
a priestly order which contains various rigid caste distinctions --
warrior-priests, mystical healers, maybe an oracle -- and each city
has its own cosmic importance as the home of a particular patron
deity. Maybe these deities are aspects or derivations of one or two
of the ancient god-kings, whose identities and deeds are
essentially mythological at this point, thousands of years after
the ancient great war. I'm attaching a few pictures below to help
envision the massive cities of Orak:

Orak likely does not have a need for such infrastructure because of the fertile soil near the rivers, but it could be used in some lakeside areas closer to mountains, maybe?](/home/john/pictures/rpg/aztec-architecture.jpg)

I like the idea of having massive networks of catacombs (maybe even a cult of necromancers) under the cities.](/home/john/pictures/rpg/entrance-to-karnak-temple.jpg)

## History/Background

The first permanent settlements in this river valley date to
500-700 years after the War of the God-Kings. Within several
decades, the valley was marred by conflict as the expansive
city-states of the region clashed over territory and resources.
Over time, one of these cities emerged as the hegemon. This city --
"Orak" -- slowly subsumed smaller villages under its tributary
system, taxing them in exchange for "protection" from the king of
the city. After a series of military victories over surrounding
rulers, in addition to some politically savvy marriage alliances,
the king of Orak established himself as the highest ranking
political leader of the area some 600 years before the player's
journey. Because of the strict adherence to religious
jurisprudence, the political leaders of Orak have often found
themselves at odds with the priests and oracles whose blessing is
necessary to maintain public support among certain segments of the
population, especially the laboring classes (farmers, independent
artisans like blacksmiths) who make up the majority of the society.
Typically, there is an uneasy truce between different socioeconomic
and political factions.

## Religion/Magic

Organized religion is the backbone of Orak society. The people of
the region believe in dozens of gods and goddesses of varying
importance who possess different types of wisdom and power. One god or
goddess tends to be most important to a particular city, with
massive temple complexes and various cults dedicated to the patron
deities of each city. The political and religious activities of
each cult is governed by the priestly order that works directly
with the monarchy -- in theory. Unorthodox religious activity is not
outlawed, but regarded with suspicion. However, in practice,
the priestly caste is mostly relegated to the temples and wealthy
districts of the cities. In the more rural villages and the
inner-city areas, people worship countless deities in countless
ways, including practices which are frowned upon by religious
authorities (like ancestor worship, necromancy, or human sacrifice.)
These practitioners are a minority, though; most attend the temples and pay tithes to the priests. The religious order -- and
some political leaders -- are able to use magic through communion with
supernatural entities, although the exact mechanism for doing so is
mysterious -- maybe it comes from a ley-line nearby.

## Economy/Culture

Orak is an agricultural society whose stable crop is a grain
similar to wheat (or maybe maize). There is a deity that represents
each river represented by a myth about two brothers or two sisters
who came down from the mountains and were somehow transformed into
the rivers. Timber is scarce compared to the rest of the continent,
but the area is extremely rich in minerals; there is more than
enough stone to build megalithic structures, which are common in
the urban centers. In the central districts of the city, the upper
classes live off the agricultural surplus produced by commoners,
extracted through taxes by government officials and tithes paid to
the clergy. On the outskirts of the cities are large plantations
run by landholding elites as well as small farms owned by
independent "yeomen." These agricultural areas often spill out into
small rural villages of poor farmers who tend to be more
superstitious than the urban citizens; many of them follow customs
and religious practices that the priests frown upon despite
considering themselves devout. There are a few mining districts
near the mountains, but the mountainous areas are generally
inaccessible from the Orak heartland. The majority of rare mineral
resources in the mountains are easier to access from the north.
Moreover, the farmers of Orak view mountain-dwellers as uncivilized
compared to agriculturalists; there is a cultural preference for
working the land oneself and earning one's living as a simple
laborer.

At times, this cultural ethos clashes with the political and
economic realities of life in Orak. The average citizen is devoted
to the religious dictates of the priestly order, but they
paradoxically view political and economic elites with disdain. Many
farmers and peasants see the landholders, merchants, and government
officials in the cities as cruel and out-of-touch. The more radical
elements in the area might even see them as parasites because they
profit off the work of the farmers without doing labor themselves,
and they don't have as much of a religious justification as
the priestly castes. By the way -- I'm using the word "caste" to
denote a rigid class that most members are born into. Technically,
it is possible to join one of these priestly orders. However, it
should be somewhat difficult due to the elitist nature of the
religious order. For example, the player should only be able to
join one of these castes if they have a high disposition with the
relevant NPC, are already a member of a cult that worships the same
god, or something similar. In general, almost every aspect of civic
and political life is governed through the religious hierarchy in
one way or another. However, there are also people -- mostly
merchants, civil servants, and wealthier urban artisans -- who are
much less religious than the average citizen and view the priestly
order as an obstacle to the political and economic reforms that
would benefit them most.
